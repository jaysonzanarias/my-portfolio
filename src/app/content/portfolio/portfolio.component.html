            Hi! Below are some of the projects that I've worked on in the past from fully fledged application to
            some random pet projects, hackathon entry, POC, etc. Most of them I've created alone from ground-up,
            other examples are by team where Iâ€™m working mostly on critical parts. Unfortunately, some of the really
            cool projects I've done in the past are NDA protected and I cannot fully share them here, anyways,
            thank you for visiting my site and I still hope you enjoy and get a glimpse of what kind of developer or
            person I am. Will be happy to hear a random feedback from you or if you simply want to connect feel free
            to visit the Contact page for more details. Thank you! :)
